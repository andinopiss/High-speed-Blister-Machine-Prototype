# High-speed-Blister-Machine-Prototype
It's a prototype for a high-speed blister machine 

#About our Design
We propose a series of design changes to optimize our tablet packaging process, focusing on efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and improved customer accessibility. The primary modifications include the placement of semipermeable sheets, the integration of a loader/feeder system, and the introduction of a cutting-edge unloader equipped with robotic arms and an inbuilt stamping system for printing crucial information like the expiry date. 

These changes offer several key advantages. Firstly, by utilizing printed paper instead of traditional aluminum foil, we significantly reduce production costs. This shift also streamlines the sealing process, saving valuable time in the packaging line. Furthermore, printed paper packaging is more easily accessible for our customers, enhancing the overall user experience.

Additionally, the incorporation of printed sheets eliminates the need for a separate printing step, thus reducing the machine's overall size and footprint. The feeder system, integrated into our new design, ensures swift and efficient loading of tablets, making the process both faster and capable of handling larger quantities. To ensure quality control, a monitoring system is employed to verify the precise placement of tablets, minimizing the risk of unoccupied spaces.

Moreover, this revamped design reduces costs not only in terms of materials but also by consolidating multiple processes into a single machine, which leads to lower installation and maintenance expenses. In conclusion, our proposal offers a comprehensive solution that enhances both the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of our tablet packaging system, while also improving customer accessibility.
